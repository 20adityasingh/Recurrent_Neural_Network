Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)


Overview:


This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequential data processing. The notebook provides a hands-on approach to understanding how RNNs function and how they can be applied to time-series or text-based data.

Features:


      Data preprocessing for sequential modeling

      Implementation of a Simple RNN using TensorFlow/Keras

      Training and evaluation of the RNN model

      Visualization of loss and accuracy trends



Technologies Used:
      Python

      Jupyter Notebook

      TensorFlow/Keras

      NumPy & Pandas

      Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)



Dataset:


The notebook uses a sample sequential dataset. Data preprocessing steps include normalization and reshaping to fit the RNN model.

Results:


The trained RNN model learns patterns from sequential data.

Loss and accuracy graphs provide insights into the model's performance.
